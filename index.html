					<summary>Programming languages I know</summary>
					<table id="language-table" class="shadow-border">
						<tr>
							<td>2014</td>
							<td>Python</td>
							<td>The first real programming language I ever learned. I used <a href="https://codingbat.com/python" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CodingBat</a> to practice, and didn't do anything complex with it until 2016 when I made a voice-activated computer assistant.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2014</td>
							<td>HTML5/CSS3</td>
							<td>It may not be a programming language but it's important enough to note. I was wholly self-taught. Web development interested me, but it was never something I wanted to focus a career on. I used that knowledge to make this website and a website for a school club.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>????</td>
							<td>JavaScript</td>
							<td>JavaScript slowly leaked into my head over time. I can't recall a specific time I was actively learning it, but I can use it well now.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2017</td>
							<td>Java</td>
							<td>I maintain that this is objectively not a good language, but the JVM backing it is good software. This was the first language I learned that used braces and semicolons and ignored indentation, so it was a rude awakening to "real languages" different from Python.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2019</td>
							<td>GDScript</td>
							<td>GDScript is the custom scripting solution for the Godot Game Engine, which I began using in 2019. It is similar to Python, but with more game dev-specific syntax and native types. Godot is a game engine that I have used for a long time (without any finished games to show for it).</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2021</td>
							<td>C#</td>
							<td>It's Java but if Microsoft forked it and implemented boatloads of nice stuff. Pretty fun language!</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2021</td>
							<td>C++</td>
							<td>I delayed learning this language because I feared it would be difficult. It was, but it was also very liberating and enjoyable to use. Still my favorite language.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2021</td>
							<td>C</td>
							<td>I prefer C++.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2022</td>
							<td>TypeScript</td>
							<td>Much nicer than plain JavaScript. I find it funny how people initially liked dynamic typing, and then projects to add static typing back into dynamically typed languages became popular as time went on.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2022</td>
							<td>ARM Assembly</td>
							<td>Can I say I'm proficient in writing assembly? No, but I do know what compiled languages compile into and how to read assembly.</td>
						</tr>
						<tr>
							<td>2023</td>
							<td>Rust</td>
							<td>Rust is fast on its way to becoming my favorite language. Macros, enums, traits, very cool stuff! The package system is leagues ahead of what I put up with with C++.</td>

					subheading="August 2021"
					description="This project is based on a legally licensed Source engine branch. We took the CS:GO codebase, the most up-to-date version of the Source engine, and ported Portal 2 gameplay code to it. In the years since then, we have been adding new features to the engine and refactoring old code to make it easier to work with. I work on this project as a C++ programmer under NDA and UI developer."

					subheading="June 2021"
					description="Chira Engine is a game engine I have been working on for almost two years. It was created to learn C++ and how game engines worked, and it taught me (and continues to teach me) a great deal about both of those subjects, as well as the CMake build system.

					subheading="March 2021"
					description="This was my first foray into C#. I decided to build a simple game engine using OpenGL for the graphics, Bullet for physics, and FMOD for sound. It currently can create unlit meshes, physics objects, and has several demos in a separate C# project to showcase its functionality. All the engine features are as abstracted as possible."

I created most of it at the beginning of the Covid-19 quarantine, when I was stuck at home without many major responsibilities eating away at my free time. I wanted to advance my 3D modeling skill through practicing modeling household items, and I wanted to physically be inside the laboratory in the show. This project also includes a working CRT TV, so I can watch the TV show from inside the show."

Then I realized I could do what the developers of C did and make my own language. It supports everything I needed to do for my class except working with arrays. By the end of the class I was in the middle of rewriting the parser, an effort I abandoned when I no longer had the need to use the language."

It allows users to list stored file entries in a VPK, and retrieve file contents."

					description="This header-only library allows users to load and call functions from dynamic libraries (.DLL on Windows, .DYLIB on macOS, .SO on Linux). Any return value is stored in the second parameter of the call function. It was created to interface with the Steam API without using proprietary headers, and so MSVC-compiled libraries would work with MinGW-compiled applications."

Instead of having a chat box inside the game, obscuring parts of the screen, the chat is displayed in a separate window outside of the main game window. It supports all the features the regular chat does, including text formatting and clickable links. It also has a "DMs" panel, where players can send private messages to other players in a convenient UI, rather than typing "/msg PlayerNameHere message contents" and having to constantly scan the incoming chat for a reply. More features are planned in the future.'

					heading='Minecraft Python Command API'
					subheading="August 2020"
					description="This mod aims to add a way for Python programs to run commands inside a video game called Minecraft. It allows users to run Python code from inside the game's chat or server console, scan for Python programs inside a preset directory, and run any program from the chat or console. These programs would then be able to modify the state of the game through custom functions included in the mod, like printing messages to the chat and console, or placing blocks within the world. I have created all the code for this mod, but it depends on the standalone Jython Java library to run the Python code, because the video game is written in Java."

The antiviruses studied were Symantec, Kaspersky, and TrendMicro. The collection of data was undertaken by a custom Python program, and the data was analyzed and charted by another Python program. This research was done for an internship at Delaware State University, under Dr. Kul, in the summer of 2019."

The data gathered was over 2 dimensions, but using Principal Component Analysis I could reduce it to a 2D scatter plot, to visualize the findings. The data shows that each LED has a slightly different spectra due to small manufacturing differences, meaning in the future they could be used as a secure physical key.

					subheading="January 2020"
					description="My submission for the science fair in 2020 was a security device that could add a sense of depth to footage, viewable in the Oculus Quest VR headset. I used two Raspberrry Pi's with camera modules attached, to livestream their camera feeds over the Internet. Then, I created a Unity application to capture the data and relay it to each lens of the headset. Ultimately, however, it was a failure, as the two camera streams did not merge together in the headset as I had hoped. Instead it just gives the user the power to see cross-eyed."
